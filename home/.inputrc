# If set to on, words which have more than one possible completion without
# any possible partial completion cause the matches to be listed immediately

# If set to On, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of
# possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list.
set menu-complete-display-prefix on

# If  set to On, when listing completions, readline displays the common prefix
# of the set of possible completions using a different color.  The color
# definitions are taken  from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable.
set colored-completion-prefix on

# If set to On, readline displays possible completions using different colors
# to indicate their file type.  The color definitions are taken from the value
# of the LS_COLORS environment variable.
set colored-stats on

#  If  set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in a
#  case-insensitive fashion.
set completion-ignore-case on

# If set to On, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, readline treats  hyphens
# (-)  and underscores  (_)  as  equivalent when performing case-insensitive
# filename matching and completion.
set completion-map-case on

# If set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a
# single match into  the  line.   It's only active when performing completion
# in the middle of a word.  If enabled, readline does not insert characters
# from the completion that match  charac- ters  after  point  in  the word
# being completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not
# duplicated.
set skip-completed-text on

# If set to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is
# appended  to the filename when listing possible completions.
